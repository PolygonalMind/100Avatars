# 100Avatars
The following repository contains around 100 avatars made by Polygonal Mind team back in 2018.

This project started with a silly challenge, create 100 avatars in 100 consecutive days.

Later on we started to rig them properly using Mixamo, add visemes and upload them into VRChat around April of 2019. After a few models uploaded the VRChat team showed a lot of interest on our creations.

During all this year, we've seen our avatars being used by a lot of people on VRChat, Twich streaming and Youtube videos. Also a huge amount of players reached out  to ask about the original files, so they can mix them and create their own avatars based on ours.

Opening this project as opensource is something we've been trying to do all this time but we wanted to rigg and add visemes ourselves before releasing the files. We no longer have the time to invest on this project, so after a year is about time we open the gates of creativity to everybody regardless the technical issues

On Polygonal Mind we believe on interoperability among VR platforms and we want our avatars to be on every corner of the Metaverse.

This is an open call to all creatives and creators to use and implement them on any project they want.

The only thing we’re asking, is not to sell this avatars without any major modification. This is a free gift to the world, you can use them as a base for your own creations and make money out of it, but you can’t sell them directly.

We’ll keep building the Metaverse, please consider following and supporting us on Twitter.
